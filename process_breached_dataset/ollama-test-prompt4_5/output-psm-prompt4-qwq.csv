Maybe the username is ""qazzaq96@bk.ru"" and the password is after the semicolon? So the user might be using the same email as the username and the password is the part after. Therefore, the new passwords should not have ""qazzaq96@bk.ru"" in them at all, but the user might still be using that email as the username. However, the user just wants the password part changed. Wait, actually, the provided passwords include both the username and password separated by semicolon. So the entire string is the password? Or is the username part part of the password? Hmm, maybe the user is inputting their current credentials as ""username;password"", so the entire string is their stored password.

In that case, the new passwords can have the same username but different password parts. But the user said the provided passwords are breached, so probably the entire combination is bad, so better to change both? But the user might not want to change the username.
